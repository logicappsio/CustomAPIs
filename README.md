## How to use Custom APIs with PowerApps and Microsoft Flow

Custom APIs are simply any RESTful APIs that you can use bring in and use with your PowerApps and Microsoft Flow.
The APIs that you register with PowerApps can be hosted anywhere, as long as a well-documented specification that conforms to the [OpenAPI](https://openapis.org/specification) standard is available.

#### Authentication

You can use one of the two authentication mechanisms supported today: 
##### - Basic Authentication
##### - OAuth 2.0
*Support for API key authentication is coming soon.*

Following is the list of all the supported OAuth 2.0 providers, with support for more coming soon

- Azure Active Directory
- Box
- Dropbox
- DocuSign
- Facebook
- Google
- Instagram
- OneDrive
- Outlook
- Slack
- Zendesk
- Microsoft Live ID
- SalesForce
- Slack
- Stripe
- Yammer

You can learn more about how to specify the authentication type in your OpenAPI (Swagger) document [here](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md#securityDefinitionsObject). 
If your API endpoint allows for unauthenticated access, you should omit the securityDefintion object from the OpenAPI (Swagger) document.

### Examples
* [Azure Resource Manager](./AzureResourceManager/README.md) with AAD authentication
* [Azure WebApp](./WebAPI/README.md) with AAD authentication

### How to create a Custom API

Head on over to the PowerApps [web portal](https://web.powerapps.com) and navigate to the __Connections__ tab under the Manage dropdown, click on __Add a connection__ in the top right corner and then click on the Custom tab and then __New Custom API__ button, in the top right corner.

Here you can upload your Swagger document and icon for the CustomAPI. If you are using OAuth2 for authentication you may have to provide additional information. See examples for more details.

You can learn more about how to customize your Swagger document to work with PowerApps and Logic flows [here](./HowToSwagger.md).

### Sharing a Custom API
Users can also share custom APIs with each other. Once you have created a custom API, on the Connections tab under the Manage dropdown, click on __Add a connection__ in the top right corner and then click on the Custom tab. 
Go the details page of the Custom API you would like to share with other users, and click on the share tab as highlighted in the image below. 
You can share the custom API with varying level of permissions with other users. Don't forget to hit save once you have finished adding or removing users for the changes to take place.

*Note: You can share custom APIs with other users in your organization only.*

### Quota and throttling

- You can create upto 5 Custom APIs in a given PowerApps account. Custom APIs shared with you don't count against this quota.
- For each connection created on a Custom API, users are allowed to make up to 500 requests per minute.
- Keep in mind that deleting a Custom API will also delete all the connections created on it.
